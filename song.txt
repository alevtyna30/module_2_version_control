My life, my life, my life, my life
In the sunshine, everybody loves the sunshine
Sunshine, everybody loves the sunshine
Sunshine, folks get down in the sunshine
Sunshine, folks get brown in the sunshine

[Bridge]
Just bees and things and flowers
Just bees and things and flowers
Just bees and things and flowers
Just bees and things and flowers

My life, my life, my life, my life
In the sunshine, everybody loves the sunshine
Sunshine, everybody loves the sunshine
Sunshine, folks get down in the sunshine
Sunshine, folks get brown in the sunshine

[Verse]
Feel what I feel, when I feel what I feel
When I'm feelin', in the sunshine
Feel what I feel, when I feel what I feel
When I'm feelin', in the sunshine
Do what I do, when I do what I do
When I'm doin', in the sunshine
Do what I do, when I do what I do
When I'm doin', in the sunshine

Somewhere I Belong
(When this began) I had nothin' to say
And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me
(I was confused) And I let it all out to find
That I'm not the only person with these things in mind
(Inside of me) But all the vacancy the words revealed
Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel
(Nothing to lose) Just stuck, hollow, and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own
