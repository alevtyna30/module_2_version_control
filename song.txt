My life, my life, my life, my life
In the sunshine, everybody loves the sunshine
Sunshine, everybody loves the sunshine
Sunshine, folks get down in the sunshine
Sunshine, folks get brown in the sunshine

[Bridge]
Just bees and things and flowers
Just bees and things and flowers
Just bees and things and flowers
Just bees and things and flowers

My life, my life, my life, my life
In the sunshine, everybody loves the sunshine
Sunshine, everybody loves the sunshine
Sunshine, folks get down in the sunshine
Sunshine, folks get brown in the sunshine

[Verse]
Feel what I feel, when I feel what I feel
When I'm feelin', in the sunshine
Feel what I feel, when I feel what I feel
When I'm feelin', in the sunshine
Do what I do, when I do what I do
When I'm doin', in the sunshine
Do what I do, when I do what I do
When I'm doin', in the sunshine
